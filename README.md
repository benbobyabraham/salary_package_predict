This is a simple demonstration for deployment of a machine learning model as a web application in heroku using a simple salary package predictor using a linear regressor model and the number of years in experience, interview score and test score as the determining features. 

Check out the [Live Demo](https://salary-package-predict.herokuapp.com/) here.

This is mainly intended for learning purposes of heroku deployment for my mentees.
